latexindent: If MiKTeX lacks Perl or latexindent is missing components, the command may fail. The tool will return stdout/stderr; if needed, we can add a health check for Perl in a later milestone.
chktex: Current output is returned raw. In a later milestone (advanced diagnostics), we can parse chktex output lines into structured diagnostics for your MCP client.
