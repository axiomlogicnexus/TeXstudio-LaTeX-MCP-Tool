Persistent process pool for external tools
Merit: low (≈30–40%) for this workload. Most tools we call are short-lived, and maintaining persistent child processes yields marginal gains while increasing complexity (lifecycle management, cross-OS stability). On Windows especially, pooling stdin/stdout workers for these specific utilities isn’t commonly beneficial.
Decision: defer. Not implemented; keep as optional for a future measurement-driven iteration.
